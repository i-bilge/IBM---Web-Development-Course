# What is jsfiddle?
    Jsfiddle is a playground for the novice and experienced web developers alike. It is an online web application which allows anyone to play around with html, css and javascript. As you make changes you can see the impact of those changes live.
## how to use
    The html area is the place where you would type all the html tags and the web page text.

    The css area is the place where you would type in css styling information.

    The javascript area is the place where you would type in the javascript code to make your web page interactive.

    The preview area is the place where your web page would be displayed as it would on a web browser.

    The most important one for you is the "Run" button. Whenever you make any changes in any area, you will have to click on the "Run" button to refresh the preview area.

    And the best thing about jsfiddle, no matter what you do you can't break anything here.

    Your exercises are given below. Try them out.

# Exercise 1 : Fiddle with html.
    Html provides the text content and the markup of a web page.

In the HTML AREA, line number 10 has the main heading of the page.

    Replace Tom with your name.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see the new heading with your name in the preview area.
Line number 13 defines a paragraph using <p> tag. Line number 14 has the text displayed inside the paragraph.

    Replace the text with the text of your choice.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.
Line number 16 defines a division using <div> tag. Line number 17 has the text displayed inside the div.

    Replace the text with the text of your choice.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see the new text reflected in the preview area.

# Exercise 2 : Fiddle with css.
    Css provides the styling information to the browser. The browser uses this information to pick information like colors, fonts and sizes.

In the CSS AREA, line number 2 controls the background color of the web page..

    Replace 'tan' with 'grey'.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see the new color reflected in the preview area.
    blue, red, green, light blue, yellow are all valid colors. Fiddle with them.
Line number 6 controls the font used to display the text in the paragraph.

    Replace 'Arial' with 'Times'.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see the new font reflected in the preview area.
Line number 13 controls how wide the div should be.

    Change the width to 400px.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    You should see a wider div.

# Exercise 3 : Fiddle with javascript.
    Javascript makes a web page interactive. When you click on the Wish button, the page wishes you "Hello how are you doing?"

In the JAVASCRIPT AREA, line number 2 defines the message that has to be displayed whenever the "wish" button is clicked.

    Replace the message with 'Good Day'.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    Click on the "wish" button in the preview area.
    You should see a pop-up alert with your new message.
    Try with "Hola, como estas". By the way that is "Hello how are you doing" in Spanish.
Line number 5 has a function named showtime. It displays the current time.

    In the HTML AREA, line number 21 has the word 'Wish'. Replace it with 'Show Time'.
    Replace 'hello()' in line number 20 with 'showtime()'.
    Click on the "Run" button.
    In the preview area, you will now see a button name 'Show Time'.
    Click on it. It will pop up a message with the current time.

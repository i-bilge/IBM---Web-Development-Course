In this module, you learned that:

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables developers to add dynamic content to webpages.

JavaScript variables are declared using the var keyword and take their type from the value assigned.

Program execution is controlled by statements like If…Then…Else, Switch, For loops, and While loops.

JavaScript uses functions: blocks of code that can be called from anywhere in the script.

Client-side scripts are programs that accompany HTML documents and are used by developers to incorporate more interactive elements.

Developers can access HTML DOM elements from JavaScript scripts using the correct DOM notation.

APIs are often used to access HTML DOM elements in web pages.
